# RapidFire
A game where you aim to get the target as much as possible before the timer runs out.
This project was for the City Bootcamp I had in the beginning of my 1st Year at City University London

## What did I do
* Created a class for the timer and ball(target)
* Implemented sound via the processing sound library
* Used switch statements to allow the implementation of a simple GUI
    * This involved creating buttons that accept button clicks based on the mouse's X & Y position.
